            <h1 class="page-title">About us</h1>
            <p>we are a well known bar that build its repetation at Walsall College selling waffles the waffles were so significantly delicous that every student bought them off us. eventually enough capital was raised and we had our first small cafe insde Tesco the sales was flying up and more and more poeple came for those delicous waffles. we also started selling sandwiches and chicken wings and our popularity grew. eventually we became so big that we met the queen</p>
            <h1>What happanend next?</h1>
            <p>first thing the queen said to me and the co-founders was "How did you come up with such a delicous recipe for a bagel?" we looked at each other and couldnt answer. The queen then started eating the bagel in full delight while doing so she maintainend eye contact and licked her lips her having one last taste off the delicous bagel. She then satisfied arose from her throne and said by this amazing level off taste you shall be knighted.</p>
            <p> we couldnt believe it we couldn't believe that we was going to get knighted by the queen! the moment was breath taking. A few years now passed and we got 12,457 stores all over the world and everyone is enjoying the satisfying tastes we offer sadily the queen banned us from selling the bagels because she wanted them just for herself. In all fairness we didn't mind because she gave us a large amount off money. Reason she wanted it banned is because it tastes to good way better than the waffles</p>
            <p>Now the sad news is we went bankrupt because a giant octopus attacked all our stores it was devistating. even the president off the united states off america got upset. He got so upset that he enforced a border wall and had its government shutdown for 3 months. He called it a global emergancy. Now we have only got one store open which is located in the city nowhere you can visit it when you want and taste the delicous tastes we have to offer.</p>
